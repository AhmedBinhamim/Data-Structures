# Data-Structures
The three programs implemented in this project are Hash Table using chaining algorithm, 
Binary Search Tree using AVL tree and Priority Queue of type Maximum Heap.

This project goal was to produce three programs for three different data structures, which are, 
Hash Table, Binary Search Tree and Priority Queue. Besides implementation of data structure 
programs, three data sets were created with size 100, 1000000 and 5000000 to be stored using the 
implemented data structure. Two search sets each consisting of size 10, were created to test searching 
in the data structure for Binary Search Tree and Hash Table. 

After the data sets and search sets were generated and programs were implemented and tested. 
The three programs were experimented using the same hardware specs and the experimental results 
were inserted in a tabular format under section 6 of this report. 

Besides experimental results, this report contains a brief description about each program and a conclusion of the activities that was 
carried throughout implementation process.
